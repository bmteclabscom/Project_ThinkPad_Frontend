# Project: Thinkspace
:cloud: A virtual space for annonymously sharing ideas. :cloud:

## Overview
 
<h3>Project: Thinkspace is a virtual reality environment allowing users to share and view ideas, annonymously.</h3>

I've been inspired to create a 3D virtual space where an individual can add an idea reflecting on any topic or question without having to consider who will see it and how they may be judged. I see this being useful anywhere from an office which wants to promote employees to share opinions, to being used as a social network for individuals to see opinions from around people they may not typically interact with. 

Users have their own **spaces** which would be dynamically altered by a custom **filter interface**. When a user sets and saves their filter interface, their **3D virtual environment** would find relevant ideas and introduce them to our users space. The user may then **interact** with the ideas, further modify the filters, or even **add** their own ideas.

### Examples of how someone might use ThinkSpace.

**Case One**

I've heard an idea which I think amazing and unique. This idea inspired and assisted me to see the world in a way I hadn't before. I'm now wondering if there are other ideas like this floating around the world? I hop into Thinkspace.

I sit back and observe these ideas . . .

As these ideas steadily move past my screen, one particular idea catches my attention among the rest. I want to take my time to read it, and potentially interact with it . . .

I now have the flexibility to interact with this idea. Using a provided interface I can then interact with the idea, either promoting, demoting, or assigning emotional response.

**This feature is not yet released**

**Case Two**

I had a profound thought I believe can greatly increase the productivity at my office, but I don't want to take credit for the idea. I log into ThinkSpace and share my idea annonymously and watch as others interact.
