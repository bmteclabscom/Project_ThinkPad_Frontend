# Project: Thinkspace
:cloud: A 3D virtual space for annonymously sharing ideas. :cloud:

## Overview
 
### Project: Thinkspace is a virtual reality environment allowing users to view and share ideas, annonymously.

I'm inspired to create a space where individuals can add ideas reflecting on raw or controversial topics without having to consider who will see it and how they may be judged. That same user may then search ThinkSpace for similar ideas, based on various filters. I envision this program to have various implementations, from an office which wants to promote employees to share their opinions to being a world-wide annonymous creative network.

Users have their own **spaces** which would be dynamically altered by a custom **filter interface**. When a user sets and saves their filter interface, their **3D virtual environment** would extract relevant ideas and introduce them to our users curated space. The user may then **interact** with the ideas, further modify the filters, or even **add** ideas of their own. 

**Current and Future features are displayed in bold ^^^.**

### Examples of how someone might use ThinkSpace.

**Case One**:

I've heard an idea which I think unique and had allowed me to see my reality in a way I hadn't before. I'm wondering if there are other ideas like this floating around the world?  I hop into Thinkspace.

I sit back and observe similar ideas . . .

Ideas steadily move past my screen. One in particular catches my attention. I want to carefully read it, and potentially interact with it . . .

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Case Two**:

I've had a profound thought I believe can greatly increase the productivity at my office. I want to share this idea with my peers and managers but the topic itself seems slightly controversial. I log into ThinkSpace and share my idea annonymously.
