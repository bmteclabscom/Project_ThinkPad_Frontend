I've been inspired to create a space where a human can without worry add an idea on any topic or question without having to consider who will see it and how they will be judged. My intention is to build a virtual world where users are given a space in which they can attract personally interesting ideas using custom filters. Users may then interact with any ideas which appear upon creation of their new filter. 

In example . . . 

I heard an idea which I thought was amazing and unique. This idea inspired and assisted me to see the world in a way I hadn't before. I'm now wondering if there are other ideas like this floating around the world? I hop into Thinkspace and set filters using key words relating to the inspiring idea.

I sit back and watch as other ideas relating to this key word begin to appear in my space. I can now sit back and observe these ideas.
